# Shipping Functionality Fixes

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. **Missing Database Relationships**
**Problem**: The `SalesOrderItem` model was missing relationships to `InventoryItem` and `StockMovement`, causing errors when trying to access inventory data during shipping.

**Fix**: Added the missing relationship in `models.py`:
```python
class SalesOrderItem(Base):
    # ... existing fields ...
    
    # Relationships
    sales_order = relationship("SalesOrder", back_populates="items")
    product = relationship("Product", back_populates="sales_order_items")
    inventory_item = relationship("InventoryItem")  # ← Added this line
```

### 2. **Stock Movement Creation Issues**
**Problem**: The `update_sales_order_status` function was trying to access `item.inventory_item` directly, but the relationship wasn't properly defined, causing errors.

**Fix**: Updated the function to properly query inventory items and handle errors:
```python
# Before (broken):
if item.inventory_item:
    item.inventory_item.quantity_available -= item.quantity_ordered

# After (fixed):
if item.inventory_item_id:
    inventory_item = db.query(InventoryItem).filter(InventoryItem.id == item.inventory_item_id).first()
    if inventory_item and inventory_item.quantity_available >= item.quantity_ordered:
        inventory_item.quantity_available -= item.quantity_ordered
        # ... rest of the logic
```

### 3. **Dashboard Activities Not Showing "Out" Movements**
**Problem**: The dashboard was only showing stock movements but not properly displaying "out" activities from sales orders.

**Fix**: Updated the dashboard functions to:
- Use `abs(movement.quantity)` to show positive numbers for both "in" and "out" movements
- Include sales order activities in recent activities
- Show both purchase orders and sales orders in the timeline

### 4. **Missing Edit Functionality**
**Problem**: The sales order edit route was missing, causing 404 errors when trying to edit orders.

**Fix**: Added complete edit functionality:
- `GET /{so_id}/edit` route for displaying edit form
- `POST /{so_id}/edit` route for updating orders
- Edit template with pre-filled form data
- Validation to prevent editing shipped/delivered orders
- Support for adding/removing products during edit

### 5. **Missing Partial Shipment Functionality**
**Problem**: The system only supported full order shipping, not partial shipments.

**Fix**: Added a new route `/sales-orders/{so_id}/partial-shipment` that allows:
- Partial shipment of specific items
- Proper stock deduction for partial quantities
- Stock movement tracking for partial shipments
- Automatic order status updates when all items are shipped

### 6. **Improved Inventory Selection**
**Problem**: When creating sales orders, the system didn't use FIFO (First In, First Out) inventory selection.

**Fix**: Updated inventory selection to use FIFO:
```python
available_inventory = db.query(InventoryItem).filter(
    InventoryItem.product_id == product_ids[i],
    InventoryItem.quantity_available >= quantities[i],
    InventoryItem.status == "available"
).order_by(InventoryItem.received_date.asc()).first()  # ← Added FIFO ordering
```

## Testing the Fixes

### Manual Testing Steps:
1. **Create a Sales Order**:
   - Go to Sales Orders → Create
   - Add products that have inventory
   - Save the order

2. **Test Edit Functionality**:
   - Go to the sales order detail page
   - Click "Edit" button
   - Modify customer, products, or quantities
   - Save changes and verify they're applied

3. **Test Full Shipping**:
   - Go to the sales order detail page
   - Change status to "shipped"
   - Verify inventory levels are reduced
   - Check stock movements are recorded

4. **Test Partial Shipping**:
   - Create a sales order with multiple items
   - Use the "Ship" button on individual items
   - Enter partial quantities
   - Verify remaining quantities are tracked

5. **Verify Dashboard Activities**:
   - Go to Dashboard
   - Check that "out" activities appear in recent activities
   - Verify sales order creation appears in timeline

### Automated Testing:
Run the test script: `python test_shipping.py`

## Database Changes Required

If you have existing data, you may need to run database migrations:

```bash
cd backend
alembic upgrade head
```

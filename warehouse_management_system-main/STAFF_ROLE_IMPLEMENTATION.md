# Staff Role Implementation - Hospital Buyers Portal

## Overview

This document outlines the implementation of role-based functionality for **staff users** who are **hospital buyers** purchasing medical supplies from the warehouse. The system now provides a clear separation between:

- **Staff (Hospital Buyers)**: Customer-facing interface for ordering medical supplies
- **Manager/Admin (Warehouse Operators)**: Warehouse management interface for fulfilling orders

## Key Changes Implemented

### 1. Dashboard Role-Based Views

#### Staff Dashboard (Hospital Buyers)
- **Welcome Message**: "Welcome to your medical supplies ordering portal"
- **KPI Cards**: 
  - Available Products (products with stock)
  - My Orders (total sales orders)
  - Pending Orders (orders in progress)
  - Stock Items (total inventory items)
- **Quick Actions**:
  - New Order (create sales order)
  - View Orders (list sales orders)
  - Browse Products (inventory view)
  - Product Catalog (products list)
- **Featured Products**: Shows available products they can order

#### Admin/Manager Dashboard (Warehouse Operators)
- **Welcome Message**: "Real-time overview of your warehouse operations"
- **KPI Cards**: Full warehouse statistics (products, alerts, inventory value, etc.)
- **Quick Actions**: Warehouse management (add products, receive stock, etc.)
- **Alerts**: System alerts and notifications

### 2. Sales Order Access

#### Staff Users Can Now:
- ✅ **Create new sales orders** (previously manager+ only)
- ✅ **View all sales orders** 
- ✅ **Edit their own orders** (if status allows)
- ✅ **Access order creation form**

#### Route Changes:
```python
# Before: Manager+ only
@router.get("/create", response_class=HTMLResponse)
async def create_sales_order_page(
    current_user: User = Depends(check_user_role_from_cookie("manager")),
    # ...

# After: Staff, Manager, Admin can create orders
@router.get("/create", response_class=HTMLResponse)
async def create_sales_order_page(
    current_user: User = Depends(check_user_roles_from_cookie(["staff", "manager"])),
    # ...
```

### 3. Inventory Role-Based Views

#### Staff View (Customer-Facing):
- **Page Title**: "Available Products - Medical Supplies Portal"
- **Header**: "Available Products" with "Place Order" and "Product Catalog" buttons
- **Data**: Shows products with available stock (what they can order)
- **Actions**: "View Details" and "Order Now" buttons
- **Statistics**: Customer-relevant metrics (available products, stock levels)

#### Admin/Manager View (Warehouse Management):
- **Page Title**: "Inventory Overview - Warehouse Management System"
- **Header**: "Inventory Overview" with "Receive Stock" and "Adjust Stock" buttons
- **Data**: Full inventory items with warehouse management details
- **Actions**: View, adjust, and receive stock buttons
- **Statistics**: Warehouse management metrics (low stock alerts, reorder points)

### 4. Navigation Updates

#### Staff Users See:
- Dashboard
- Categories
- Products
- Available Products (instead of "Inventory")
- My Orders (instead of "Sales Orders")
- Product Catalog (additional menu item)

#### Admin/Manager Users See:
- Dashboard
- Categories
- Products
- Inventory
- Purchase Orders
- Sales Orders
- Customers
- Vendors
- Alerts
- Reports
- Settings

#### Hidden from Staff:
- Purchase Orders (warehouse management)
- Customers (warehouse management)
- Vendors (warehouse management)
- Alerts (warehouse management)
- Reports (warehouse management)
- Settings (system administration)

## Technical Implementation

### 1. Dashboard Route Updates
```python
# Role-based dashboard data
if current_user.role in ["admin", "manager"]:
    # Warehouse management view
    stats = calculate_dashboard_stats(db, now, thirty_days_ago)
    recent_activities = get_recent_activities(db)
    alerts = get_active_alerts(db)
else:
    # Customer-facing view for staff
    stats = calculate_staff_dashboard_stats(db, now, thirty_days_ago, current_user)
    recent_activities = get_staff_recent_activities(db, current_user)
    available_products = get_available_products_for_staff(db)
```

### 2. Inventory Route Updates
```python
# Role-based inventory view
if current_user.role in ["admin", "manager"]:
    return await warehouse_inventory_view(request, current_user, db)
else:
    return await customer_inventory_view(request, current_user, db)
```

### 3. Template Updates
- **Dashboard**: Conditional rendering based on `user_role`
- **Inventory**: Conditional rendering based on `view_type` ('warehouse' vs 'customer')
- **Navigation**: Role-based menu item visibility

## User Experience

### Staff Users (Hospital Buyers)
1. **Login** → See customer-facing dashboard
2. **Browse Products** → View available medical supplies
3. **Place Orders** → Create sales orders for needed supplies
4. **Track Orders** → Monitor order status and delivery
5. **Product Catalog** → Access detailed product information

### Admin/Manager Users (Warehouse Operators)
1. **Login** → See warehouse management dashboard
2. **Manage Inventory** → Receive, adjust, and monitor stock
3. **Process Orders** → Fulfill customer orders
4. **System Management** → Configure alerts, reports, and settings

## Security Considerations

### Role-Based Access Control
- **Staff users** cannot access warehouse management functions
- **Staff users** cannot view system settings or reports
- **Staff users** cannot manage customers or vendors
- **Admin override** still works (admin can access everything)

### Data Isolation
- Staff see the same data but in a customer context
- No sensitive warehouse information exposed to staff
- Order creation limited to appropriate user roles

## Testing Scenarios

### Test Staff Access
1. **Login as staff user** (`staff` / `staff123`)
2. **Verify dashboard** shows customer-facing interface
3. **Test order creation** - should work for staff users
4. **Test inventory view** - should show available products
5. **Verify navigation** - warehouse items hidden

### Test Admin/Manager Access
1. **Login as admin/manager** (`admin` / `admin123` or `manager` / `manager123`)
2. **Verify dashboard** shows warehouse management interface
3. **Test all functions** - should work as before
4. **Verify navigation** - all items visible

### Test Unauthorized Access
1. **Staff user** tries to access `/inventory/receive` → 403 Forbidden
2. **Staff user** tries to access `/settings` → 403 Forbidden
3. **Staff user** tries to access `/reports` → 403 Forbidden

## Future Enhancements

### Customer Account Linking
- Link staff users to specific customer accounts
- Show only orders for their hospital
- Personalized product recommendations

### Order History
- Staff dashboard shows their order history
- Order tracking and status updates
- Reorder functionality for common items

### Product Favorites
- Allow staff to bookmark frequently ordered products
- Quick reorder from favorites list
- Personalized product catalog

### Notifications
- Order status change notifications
- Product availability alerts
- Delivery updates

## Conclusion

The staff role implementation successfully transforms the warehouse management system into a **dual-purpose platform**:

1. **Customer Portal** for hospital buyers to order medical supplies
2. **Warehouse Management** for operators to fulfill orders and manage inventory

This provides a seamless B2B experience while maintaining proper role-based access control and data security.
